## Android JetPack
### Navigation Component

![left inline](gde-badge-round.png)

![right](aerial-shot-ship.jpg)

---

![](developing-hard.png)

^ Navigation is hard. Misnomer not great start to talk

^ Often a topic of confusion, difficult for new developers

^ Navigating from screen to screen being fundamental to your app

^ What makes navigation so confusing?

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

![75%](starting-activity.png)

^ Started with activities, Android level component

^ like content providers, services and broadcast receivers

---

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity {

  private val message: EditText
    get() = findViewById(R.id.message)
    
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle) {
    /* ... */
  }
  
  fun sendMessage() {
    val intent = Intent(this, DisplayMessageActivity::class.java)
    intent.putExtra(DisplayMessageActivity.EXTRA_MESSAGE, message.text.toString())
    startActivity(intent)
  }
}
```

^ Simplest form, use Intent to navigate

^ Quickly out of hand in larger projects

---

## üò∞

^ Activities dependent on other activity implementations

^ Store complex intent argument compositions

^ Conditional navigation difficult to maintain

---

> ### "Once we have gotten in to this entry-point to your UI, we really don't care how you organise the flow inside."
-- Dianne Hackborn, Android Framework team, 2016

^ 2016 back when Google Plus was still a thing

^ Controversial, framework not opinionated, does not care about app structure

^ Once activity started, you can handle the flow

---

## üçØ üêù

^ Honeycomb (14) breaks up screens into Fragments

^ Build richer, more interactive user interfaces

^ Beginning of design orientated thinking

---

[.background-color: #ebebeb]
[.footer: ]

![inline](contacts_full.png)

^ Demonstrated with a master / detail interface

^ Responsive layout for larger screens (tablets)

^ "also run properly on smaller screen devices"

---

```java
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.news_articles);

    // Check that the activity is using the layout version with the fragment_container FrameLayout
    if (findViewById(R.id.fragment_container) != null) {

      // However, if we're being restored from a previous state, then we don't need to do anything,
      // and should return or else we could end up with overlapping fragments.
      if (savedInstanceState != null) {
        return;
      }

      // Create a new Fragment to be placed in the activity layout
      HeadlinesFragment firstFragment = new HeadlinesFragment();
    
      // In case this activity was started with special instructions from an
      // Intent, pass the Intent's extras to the fragment as arguments
      firstFragment.setArguments(getIntent().getExtras());

      // Add the fragment to the 'fragment_container' FrameLayout
      getSupportFragmentManager()
        .beginTransaction()
        .add(R.id.fragment_container, firstFragment)
        .commit();
    }
  }
}
```

^ Sample from Android documentation, not yet in Kotlin

---

```java, [.highlight: 18, 22, 25-28]
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.news_articles);

    // Check that the activity is using the layout version with the fragment_container FrameLayout
    if (findViewById(R.id.fragment_container) != null) {

      // However, if we're being restored from a previous state, then we don't need to do anything,
      // and should return or else we could end up with overlapping fragments.
      if (savedInstanceState != null) {
        return;
      }

      // Create a new Fragment to be placed in the activity layout
      HeadlinesFragment firstFragment = new HeadlinesFragment();
    
      // In case this activity was started with special instructions from an
      // Intent, pass the Intent's extras to the fragment as arguments
      firstFragment.setArguments(getIntent().getExtras());

      // Add the fragment to the 'fragment_container' FrameLayout
      getSupportFragmentManager()
        .beginTransaction()
        .add(R.id.fragment_container, firstFragment)
        .commit();
    }
  }
}
```

^ Fragments added / removed using fragment transactions

^ More complex than starting an Activity

---

```java, [.highlight: 11-15]
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.news_articles);

    // Check that the activity is using the layout version with the fragment_container FrameLayout
    if (findViewById(R.id.fragment_container) != null) {

      // However, if we're being restored from a previous state, then we don't need to do anything,
      // and should return or else we could end up with overlapping fragments.
      if (savedInstanceState != null) {
        return;
      }

      // Create a new Fragment to be placed in the activity layout
      HeadlinesFragment firstFragment = new HeadlinesFragment();
    
      // In case this activity was started with special instructions from an
      // Intent, pass the Intent's extras to the fragment as arguments
      firstFragment.setArguments(getIntent().getExtras());

      // Add the fragment to the 'fragment_container' FrameLayout
      getSupportFragmentManager()
        .beginTransaction()
        .add(R.id.fragment_container, firstFragment)
        .commit();
    }
  }
}
```

^ Additional state issues with checking for activity recreation

^ We can get overlapping fragments after configuration change.

---

## Activity Lifecycle != Fragment Lifecycle

^ Not just creation and use of fragments that included more complexity

^  Introduced more complex lifecycle behaviour than with Activities

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è

^ Explicitly invoke addToBackStack or add on transactions

^ Can mess up back stack if not implemented correctly

^ Invalid stack, unexpected behaviour on configuration change.

---

### (supportFragmentManager || childFragmentManager)?

^ Fragments allow adding fragments inside fragments

^ Used for nested view pagers inside fragments

^ Former can leak context if used inside fragments

---

![100%](fragment-communication.png)

^ Communication between fragments is quite difficult

^ Previously check for interface onAttach or use event bus

---

## Bundles üì¶

^ Like activities we must let the system manage instance

^ Serialisation of data provided through bundles

^ Don't use fragment constructors

---

## FragmentFactory
### androidx.fragment:fragment:1.1.0-beta01

^ As ov 1.1.0 you can set a FragmentFactory on any FragmentManager

^ Control how new Fragment instances are instantiated

---

## Fragments? üôÄ

^ These are pretty compelling arguments to avoid Fragments in general

^ Tempted to use pure Activity sequences or other alternatives

^ Many alternative architecture options created, Mortar / Flow

---

## Fragments? ü§î

^ There may be some good reasons to use Fragments

---

## Activity Capabilities ‚è≥

^ Activity capabilities tied to API version, need to wait for new features

^ Activity features in new versions of Android cannot be backported

---

## Shared Element Transition (API 21+)

![right 80% autoplay loop](shared-element-animation.mp4)

^ eg SharedElementTransitions only available on API 21 and above

^ Compat shims only provide graceful failure saving API checks

---

## CompatShims < Enough

^ Hidden gotchas, don't guarantee consistent user experience

---

## ~~android.app.Fragment~~
## `androidx.fragment.app.Fragment`

^ Native Android fragment deprecated in API 28

^ Fragments entirely in androidx can be updated per app

---

## Scopes üîç

^ One of the real benefits comes in the form of scoping

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## Scopes

![inline](activity-isolated.png)

^ Sharing instances or resources across different activities is difficult

^ Each activity exists in isolation without much of a larger scope

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## Scopes

![inline](application-activity-scope.png)

^ Dependency graphs include resources only for a few screens

^ Survive for the entire duration in the application scope

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## Scopes

![inline](application-fragment-scope.png)

^ With usage of a third framework type scopes can be nested

^ Shared data can be provided by activity scope by ViewModel

---

# ¬†ü§îüßÅ

^ So how can we have our cake and eat it?

^ To benefit from the features available in fragments

^ Without suffering from the difficulties of using them

---

![inline 100%](jetpack-hero.png)

^ Last year Google introduced us to Android JetPack which included a variety of tools

^ Dedicated to helping us bootstrap Android development

^ Opinionted and clean implementations for common problems

^ With the additional of comparmentalising the support library fragment 

^ Renaming support dependencies to androidx and starting with independent versioning 

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## Android JetPack 

![inline](jetpack-foundation.png)

^ Foundation picking up where the support library left off

^ Including ktx helpers, multidex and security

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## Android JetPack 

![inline](jetpack-architecture.png)

^ Architecture encompassing the arch components like LiveData and ViewModel

^ Navigation, paging, and room persistence

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## Android JetPack 

![inline](jetpack-behaviour.png)

^ Media playback, notifications, permissions, and slices

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## Android JetPack 

![inline](jetpack-ui.png)

^ Finally UI, including Fragments, Transitions, Animations, and Emoji

---

## Android JetPack: Navigation ![](jetpack-hero.png)

^ Introducing JetPack

^ JetPack is...

---

## Android JetPack: Navigation ![](jetpack-hero.png)

- Libraries üìö
- Plugin üîå
- Tooling üîß

^ a set of libraries, a plugin, and tooling for unifying and simplifying Android Navigation

---

- Fragment transactions
- Up and back actions
- Standardised transition resources
- Deep link implementation
- Easy navigation patterns
- Type safe arguments

^ Handles all the common parts of navigation patterns

^ Easy handing of patterns like drawers or bottom navigation

---

## Principles of Navigation

^ Navigation core part of UX, principles set consistent / intuitive UX

^ Designed to implement principles of navigation by default

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

## Fixed Start Destination

![inline](navigation-principles-start-destination.png)

^ Every app has a fixed start destination

^ First and last screen pressing the back button

---

## ü•û

^ Navigation state is represented as a stack of destinations

^ Representation history of the user flow

---

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

^ Up and back are identical within your apps task

---

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

^ Up never exist your application

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

## Deep linking simulates manual navigation

![inline](navigation-principles-deep-linking-2.png) 

^ Back stack will be created as though you had navigated there yourself

---

## JetPack: Navigation

![right 100%](jetpack-hero.png)

^ JetPack built from three components

---

## Navigation Graph

![](navigation-graph_2x-callouts.png)

^ Android Studio 3.3 introduces the new navigation editor

^ graphical editor to build your application navigation graph

---

[.background-color: #2d3032]
[.footer: ]

![inline](navigation-editor_2x.png)

^ Destinations to the left showing the host and graph hierarchy

^ destinations can be an activity, fragment, or custom view

^ graph editor contains a visual representation showing how the destinations interact

^ the arrows indicate actions which can be invoked programmatically

^ each destination has attributes displayed on the right

^ attributes allow you to configure arguments and deeplinks

---

**nav_graph.xml**

```xml
<navigation xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/navigation"
    app:startDestination="@+id/fragmentMain">

  <fragment
      android:id="@+id/fragmentMain"
      android:name="com.google.sample.MainFragment"
      android:label="@string/main_title"
      tools:layout="@layout/main_fragment">

    <action
        android:id="@+id/mainToViewBalance"
        app:destination="@+id/fragmentViewBalance"/>

  </fragment>

  <fragment
      android:id="@+id/fragmentViewBalance"
      android:name="com.google.sample.ViewBalanceFragment"
      android:label="@string/view_balance_title"
      tools:layout="@layout/view_balance_fragment" />

</navigation>
```

^ But if you're like me and prefer to hand code you can create your graph in xml too

---

## NavHostFragment

```xml
<fragment
    android:id="@+id/nav_host_fragment"
    android:name="androidx.navigation.fragment.NavHostFragment"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    app:defaultNavHost="true"
    app:navGraph="@navigation/nav_graph" />
```

^ Fragment widget that will act as a host for your destinations

^ Compatible only with Fragments as the navigation

^ Lifecycle, configuration, animations handled automatically

---

## NavController

- `Fragment.findNavController()`

- `View.findNavController()`

- `Activity.findNavController(viewId: Int)`

^ Each NavHostFragment has controller that allows you to invoke navigation actions 

^ NavController can be retrieved from fragment, activity, or view

^ Recommended mechanism is with navigate method

---

## Actions

```kotlin
viewTransactionsButton.setOnClickListener { view ->
   view.findNavController().navigate(R.id.viewTransactionsAction)
}
```

```kotlin
button.setOnClickListener(
    Navigation.createNavigateOnClickListener(R.id.next_fragment, null)
)
```

^ Recommended mechanism to navigate with `navigate` method and `@IdRes`

^ With controller, navigate to action defined in navigation graph

^ Alternatively create navigation listener to retrieve view controller

---

## üí™ SafeArgs

^ Plugin enables generation of type safe args from your nav graph

^ Kotlin class, null safe, and provides defaults

^ Only use primitive or parcelable values

^ Mark with @Keep to keep after Proguard

---

## SafeArgs: Directions

### [fit] `MainFragmentDirections.mainToViewBalance()`

```xml
<fragment
  android:id="@+id/fragmentMain"
  android:name="com.google.sample.MainFragment"
  android:label="@string/main_title"
  tools:layout="@layout/main_fragment">

  <action
    android:id="@+id/mainToViewBalance"
    app:destination="@+id/fragmentViewBalance"/>

</fragment> 
```

^ Given example, safe args generates direction class for destinations with an action

^ Includes necessary arguments, graph changes will break compilation

---

## SafeArgs: Directions

```xml
<fragment
  android:id="@+id/fragmentViewBalance"
  android:name="com.google.sample.ViewBalanceFragment"
  android:label="@string/view_balance_title"
  tools:layout="@layout/view_balance_fragment">
  
  <argument
    android:name="balanceAmount"
    app:argType="integer"/>

</fragment>
```

^ Lets add an argument to the view balance fragment

^ This will update the generated direction class to take the argument

^ Will also generate an args class on the destination to deserialise

---

## SafeArgs: Args

[.code-highlight: 7, 17-18]

```kotlin
class MainFragment: Fragment() {
  
  override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

    viewTransactionsButton.setOnClickListener { view ->
      MainFragmentDirections.mainToViewBalance(100)
    }
  }
}

class ViewBalanceFragment : Fragment() {
  
  override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

    val args = ViewBalanceFragmentArgs.fromBundle(arguments!!)
    balance.setText(String.format("%.2d", args.balanceAmount))
  }
}
```

^ Must now pass a parameter to the main fragment direction

^ Deserialise in the receiving balance fragment used the extras

---

## SafeArgs: Activities üéâüçæ

^ Also works with activity destinations

^ Can use plugin immediately

---

## SafeArgs: Activities

```kotlin
class MainActivity : Activity {

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
    val args = ViewBalanceActivityArgs(100)
    val intent = Intent(this, ViewBalanceActivity::class.java)
    
    startActivity(intent, bundle.toBundle())
  }
}
```

^ Destinations class not generated for destinations without navigation host

^ Directly use args class for intent bundle

---

## SafeArgs: Getting Started

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    google()
  }
  
  dependencies {
    classpath "androidx.navigation:navigation-safe-args-gradle-plugin:2.0.0"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'androidx.navigation.safeargs.kotlin'
```

---

## üõ† Migrating

^ May be Difficult with heavy use of activities

^ Use safeargs for activity arguments

^ Decide on benefit of migration

---

## üõ† Migrating

- Move screen behaviour away from activities

- Create new activity for NavHostFragment

- Move existing activity logic to fragment

- Initialise fragment in host activity

- Pass arguments as necessary

- Create navigation graph

^ Convert activity to fragment and include within navigation graph

^ Invoke navigation manually without using NavHost or NavController

^ Slowly move single activity/fragment pairs into larger navigation graph

---

## üí∞ Profit

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.text: #666666]

## üîç Scoping

![inline](application-destination-scope.png)

^ Navigation graph destinations can easily share data with activity view models
