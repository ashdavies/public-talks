## Android JetPack
### Navigation Component

---

Navigation is hard.

^ Starting off with a misnomer like this might not seem like a great start to a talk.

---

![](developing-hard.png)

^ Often a topic of confusion and difficult for new developers to grasp,

^ With navigating from screen to screen being such a fundamental part of your android app,

^ Why is this, what makes navigation so confusing?

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

![75%](starting-activity.png)

^ In the beginning we had activities, 

^ like content providers, services and broadcast receivers, 

^ activities are an Android level component.

---

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity {

  private val message: EditText
    get() = findViewById(R.id.message)
    
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle) {
    /* ... */
  }
  
  fun sendMessage() {
    val intent = Intent(this, DisplayMessageActivity::class.java)
    intent.putExtra(DisplayMessageActivity.EXTRA_MESSAGE, message.text.toString())
    startActivity(intent)
  }
}
```

^ In it's simplest form you would have an Android Activity, and would use an Intent to navigate from one to the other.

^ but this gets quickly out of hand in larger projects.

---

## üò∞

^ Activities knowing about other activity implementations,

^ Putting and retrieving complex intent extra compositions,

^ Conditional navigation becoming difficult to maintain.

---

## üîç Scoping

^ When building large applications you might have dependencies that need to survive a few screens,

^ expensive repositories, databases, network clients, or in-memory persisted data,

---

![100%](application-scope.png)

^ Since you need to pass data from one activity to the next,

^ dependency graphs with repositories, databases only needed for a few screens,

^ survive for the entire duration in the application scope.

---

> ## "Once we have gotten in to this entry-point to your UI, we really don't care how you organise the flow inside."
-- Dianne Hackborn, Android Framework team

^ Quite controversial, but framework isn't opinionated, and does not care about the structure of your application,

^ Once your activity is started, you can handle the flow however you see fit.

---

## üçØ üêù

^ With Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) developers could break up screens into Fragments,

^ in order to build richer, more interactive user interfaces.

---

![fit](contacts_full.png)

^ Demonstrated with a master / detail interface, 

^ responsive layout for use with larger screens such as tablets,

^ "also run properly on smaller screen devices".

---

```java
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.news_articles);

    // Check that the activity is using the layout version with
    // the fragment_container FrameLayout
    if (findViewById(R.id.fragment_container) != null) {

      // However, if we're being restored from a previous state,
      // then we don't need to do anything and should return or else
      // we could end up with overlapping fragments.
      if (savedInstanceState != null) {
        return;
      }

      // Create a new Fragment to be placed in the activity layout
      HeadlinesFragment firstFragment = new HeadlinesFragment();
    
      // In case this activity was started with special instructions from an
      // Intent, pass the Intent's extras to the fragment as arguments
      firstFragment.setArguments(getIntent().getExtras());

      // Add the fragment to the 'fragment_container' FrameLayout
      getSupportFragmentManager()
        .beginTransaction()
        .add(R.id.fragment_container, firstFragment)
        .commit();
    }
  }
}
```

^ Sample provided from the Android documentation, not available yet in Kotlin,

^ Fragments would be added, and removed using fragment transactions, 

^ quite a bit more complex than starting an Activity.

^ but would introduce a much more complex lifecycle behaviour than what we have been used to with Activities.

^ Furthermore if not implemented correctly, it's really easy to mess up your back stack,

^ leading to invalid stack and unexpected behaviour on configuration change.

---

![100%](fragment-communication.png)

^ Additionally communication between fragments is quite difficult,

^ different mechanisms such as checking for interface implementation onAttach,

^ dispatching data through an event bus.

---

Using an Activity as a larger scope with nested destination scopes, being able to share data across screens using ViewModel's or otherwise.

---

Fragments are an implementation of this destination concept, whilst mired with lifecycle issues, allowing the navigation component to handle the back stack makes this simple.

---

## Introducing the Navigation Component

---

A collection of libraries, a plugin, and tooling for unifying and simplifying Android Navigation.

---

Handles all the common facets of navigation patterns, including backstack, transactions, animations, deep links, and type safe arguments.

---

Works natively with Activity and Fragment, and with custom views should you wish to define your own destinations.

---

## Navigation Graph

---

Android Studio 3.3 introduces the new navigation editor, allowing you to utilise a graphical editor to build your application navigation graph.

---

Each screen is represented as a destination that shows how the navigation actions behave, and allow you to specify the arguments required for each screen which will allow to you pass type safe values.

---

You can also configure a deep link easily and simpliy.

---

## NavHostLayout

---

Simply a fragment widget that will act as a host for each of your fragment destinations, not compatible with Activity's. It makes sense to use Fragment's with the Navigation Library as you can easily navigate between screens and have the lifecycle, transactions, and configuration handled for you automatically.

---

## NavController

---

Each NavHostFragment has a controller that allows you to invoke navigation actions providing the necessary arguments and will perform the transactions as necessary.

---

## SafeArgs

---

When using the safeargs plugin in your project, you can add arguments to your destinations in your navigation graph to generate a type safe args class in Kotlin, that has default arguments and null safety to boot.

---

The navigation library also provides extensions for configuring BottomNavigationView simply and easily.

---

## Deep Link

---

The navigation library also allows you to easily configure deep linking by specifying a deep link in your navigation graph, which will be automatically includes in your manifest.
