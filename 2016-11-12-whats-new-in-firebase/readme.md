## Description
After this years Google I/O, Firebase was upgraded and become an even more important role in the range of Google services available. Now properly integrated with Google Services, Firebase offers developers much more than than just a database for "personal" projects.

The new updated Firebase however has left many developers a bit puzzled on how to properly include Firebase in their projects, how it integrates into Google Services, and how they can make use of the new features available.

If you’ve used Firebase already, you might be aware of how to integrate and make use of it in your applications but if not prior knowledge isn’t necessary. In this talk I’d like to share with you how migrate your existing code to the updated versions, what new features you’ll be able to take advantage of, and any pitfalls that you can hopefully avoid!
