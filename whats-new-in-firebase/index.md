## [fit] What's Firebase?

^ Development is hard and developers are lazy

---

## Step 1: Develop

- Cloud Messaging
- Authentication
- Realtime Database
- Storage
- Hosting
- Test Lab
- Crash Reporting

---

## Step 2: Grow

- Notifications
- Remote Config
- App Indexing
- Dynamic Links
- Invites
- AdWords

---

## Step 3: Profit

- AdMob

---

## Setup

^ The key difference to Firebase then and Firebase now is the set up process, in that now it is fully integrated into Google Play Services.

^ What this means is that it can interleave with the other aspects of your set up such as cloud storage, push notifications and analytics.

---

## Add Firebase to your Android app

## [fit] Firebase Origins:

## [fit]Â Realtime Database

^ When Firebase first started out, it was mostly just a realtime database.

^ Despite Firebase now describing a collective toolset of the suite of services provided now,

^ the real power of using Firebase when first starting out is still that.

^ The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud hosted NoSQL utilising the strength of Google's infrastructure to power your application.

^ Firebase Realtime Database allows developers to implement fully functioning application interfaces across multiple platforms,

^ Without having to worry about things like realtime synchronisation and conflict resolution.

---

## [fit] Intuitive

## [fit]Â Easy to use API

^ The realtime database api is stupidly simple to use, and reacts to a callback interface allowing you to simply consume the data as it is received.

---

`FirebaseDatabase.getInstance()
        .getReference("...")
        .orderByChild("...");`

---

# [fit] Offline data
# [fit] synchronisation

^ When your app loses connectivity, you would normally have to compose extensive amounts of logic to handle this failure gracefully.

^ Even with RxJava operators considerable thought must be put into how data is cached and evaluated.

^ With Firebase this is all handled for you and you can simply treat your application as though connectivity wasn't an issue.

^ Since Firebase will remain responsive regardless of network latency or internet connectivity,

^ and will synchronise on its own after data connectivity returns.

---

`FirebaseDatabase.getInstance()
.setPersistenceEnabled(true);`

---

## [fit] Includes authentication tokens

^ If your application used Firebase authentication, the users authentication tokens will be persisted across restarts allowing a seamless user experience.

^ If the token expires, database writes will be resumed until the user has been re-authenticated to make sure authentication rules are observed.

---

## [fit] Keeping data fresh

^ Additionally you can instruct Firebase to keep a particular reference updated whilst the client still has connectivity,

^ even whilst not maintaining an active reference to this Firebase reference in your code.

----

`FirebaseDatabase.getInstance()
  .getReference("...")
  .keepSynced(true);`

---

## [fit] Acquiring

## [fit] connectivity state

^ Firebase even offers a way to detect your current connection state using the same API for fetching data with the .info/connected reference.

---

```java
FirebaseDatabase.getInstance()
  .getReference(".info/connected")
  .addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener() {

    @Override
    public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot snapshot) {
      boolean connected = snapshot.getValue(Boolean.class);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCancelled(DatabaseError error) {
      System.err.println("Listener was cancelled");
    }
  });
```

---


## 10MB

^ Firebase will reserve up to 10MB by default to cache query results, and will purge this data once it reaches the configured size.

^ Data that is kept in sync however will not be cached.

---

## Can I change the configured cache size?

^ You might ask, can I increase the configured cache size to greater than 10MB?

---

## [fit] No!

^ The legacy version of Firebase offered the method setPersistenceCacheSizeBytes to override the default configuration cache size,

^ but this is no longer available and it would generally be unwise to do so since this can cause application out of memory errors.

---

## [fit] Automatic data
## [fit]Â synchronisation

^ Synchronisation remains central to core principles of the Firebase Realtime Database,

^ meaning that your data is not just synchronised on the one device but across every connected client.

^ This is massively beneficial when developing cross platform applications,

^ it means all of your clients are sharing the same realtime database and will automatically received updates with the newest data.

---

## [fit] Cloud hosted
## [fit] NoSql database

^ Your data is stored in a cloud hosted NoSql database powered by Google,

^ being one of the front runners for data indexing and big data infrastructures.

^ NoSql data structures can provide huge increases to speed and performance but require a different way of thinking when it comes to relational data structures.

---

```json
{
  "users": {
    "alovelace": {
      "name": "Ada Lovelace",
      "contacts": {
        "ghopper": true
      },
    },
    "ghopper": { ... },
    "eclarke": { ... }
  }
}
```

^ One of the most important things to remember about Firebase is how to structure your data.

^ The Firebase Realtime Database does not offer a feasible environment for relational data,

^ so as a result you must de-normalize your data structure.

^ All Firebase Realtime Database data is structured as a Json tree of key, value parameters.

^ It's recommended to use uuid as keys rather than using arrays since these are easier to use when calling `setValue` on your data.

---

## The Tasks API[^1]
^ Since Firebase is now tied in with Google Play Services, many of its API operations use the Tasks API.

^ The Tasks API provideS a meaningful semantic interface for asynchronous operations,

^ which by themselves are more than enough to allow your application to follow a logical data flow.

```java
Task<AuthResult> task = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().signInAnonymously();

task.addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<AuthResult>() {

  @Override
  public void onSuccess(AuthResult result) {
      /* ... */
  }
});

task.addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() {

  @Override
  public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception exception) {
      /* ... */
  }
});
```

^ So that messages you send will be broadcast to everybody in the area,

^ and the message history you are seeing is *your* personal history,

^ stored using Firebase Realtime Database.
