# RxJava & Coroutines
## A Practical Analysis
### Droidcon Lisbon üáµüáπ

![left inline 20%](gde-badge-round.png)

![right](concurrency.jpg)

^ Talk a culmination of discussions with developers in conferences over last few months

^ Specifically Twitter interactions and panel discussions at Droidcon Berlin 2018

^ Most people excited about coroutines, but have questions about its usage

^ Often considered to take the place of reactive frameworks like RxJava

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

![inline 25%](kotlin-logo.png)

^ Unveiled as project Kotlin in 2011 

^ Stable release in 2014, garnered support from community

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

![inline 40%](android-kotlin-hero.png)

^ Developers celebrated as Google announced first class support for Android in 2017

^ Since then adaption has sky-rocketed, community involvement and participation

^ Talks on every aspect of Kotlin, from DataBinding to Coroutines, Redux and IoT

---

![fit autoplay](kotlin-adoption-2018.mp4)

^ Study from Pusher surveyed 2744 people from January to March found Kotlin adoption doubled year on year

^ Spiking to 19.5 after the release of a document from Jake Wharton advocating its use at Square

^ Starting at 7.7%, spiking at 19.5 after JW Square document, then to 46.8 after Google IO '17

![inline](kotlin-adoption.png)

^ GitHub reported over 25 million LoC by the end of 2017

^ GitHub reported 2.6x grown in contributes by the end of 2018

^ Stack Overflow speculated one of the fasted growing and least disliked

^ Popularity and success contributed to by continued evolution of Kotlin

^ Understandable why people want to jump on the bandwagon

---

# ![](kotlin-logo.png) Coroutines 

^ Coroutines available as experimental in Kotlin 1.1 stable in 1.3 (Oct '18)

^ Available in other languages, subroutines for non-preemptive (cooperative) multitasking

^ Allow us to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous

---

```kotlin
fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,")
    Thread.sleep(2000L)
}

// Hello,
// World!
```

^ Consider the following asynchronous code

^ Sequential by default, seemingly imperative

---

```kotlin, [.highlight: 3]
fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,")
    Thread.sleep(2000L)
}

// Hello,
// World!
```

^ Delay is a suspended function, must be called from a Coroutine

---

```kotlin, [.highlight: 2, 5]
fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,")
    Thread.sleep(2000L)
}

// Hello,
// World!
```

^ Calling launch on a Coroutine scope will build a coroutine context

^ Global scope applied unconfined context

^ Scope can be created with dispatchers based on use case

---

# Coroutine Builders

^ Coroutines library provides two coroutine builder functions on a scope

---

# Coroutine Builders

```kotlin
val deferred: Deferred<String> = async { "Hello World!" }
```

^ Async returns a deferred result and must be awaited to return a result

---

# Coroutine Builders

```kotlin, [.highlight: 2]
val deferred: Deferred<String> = async { "Hello World!" }
val result: String = deferred.await()
```

^ Much like Future, Deferred represents a promise that must be awaited in a coroutine

^ Job represents work taking place and can be cancelled like Disposable or Subscription

---

# Coroutine Builders

```kotlin, [.highlight: 4]
val deferred: Deferred<String> = async { "Hello World!" }
val result: String = deferred.await()
  
val job: Job = launch { "Hello World!" }
```

^ Launch will return a job which will run in parallel until awaits

---

# Coroutine Builders

```kotlin, [.highlight: 5]
val deferred: Deferred<String> = async { "Hello World!" }
val result: String = deferred.await()

val job: Job = launch { "Hello World!" }
job.join()
```

^ Join will suspend the coroutine until the job is finished

^ Much like disposable or subscription, a job can be cancelled

---

# ‚öñÔ∏è Stability

^ In the abstract I had mentioned "with coroutines approaching stability"

^ As of Kotlin 1.3 (Oct '18) coroutines API graduated to "fully" stable

---

[.footer-style: #ffffff]

![](lie-detected.gif)

^ That wasn't completely true, but lets cover the basics

---

# @Annotations

## (üêâ Here be dragons)

^ Though coroutines are stable some API elements are still under development

^ Kotlin introduced annotations to manage these aspects

---

# Annotations

```kotlin
@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi // ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

^ Experimental API's design declarations may still change

^ Applies to Rx conversion, and channel production

---

# Annotations

```kotlin
@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi // ‚ö†Ô∏è

@FlowPreview // ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

^ Flow is a newer architectural model that attempts to model chaining behaviour

^ Much like a sequence that is only consumed on a terminal operator

^ Cold observable easily replayed and reusable

---

# Annotations

```kotlin
@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi // ‚ö†Ô∏è

@FlowPreview // ‚ö†Ô∏è

@ObsoleteCoroutinesApi // ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

^ Obsolete API's will be deprecated in the future but not yet known what will replace them

^ Difference between obsolete and experimental is intent, @Experimental may graduate, @Obsolete unknown

^ Applies to channel consumptions, actors, Rx conversion functions

---

# Annotations

```kotlin
@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi // ‚ö†Ô∏è

@FlowPreview // ‚ö†Ô∏è

@ObsoleteCoroutinesApi // ‚ö†Ô∏è

@InternalCoroutinesApi // ‚ò†Ô∏è
```

^ Should only be used internally by Kotlin coroutines

^ Can change without warning or migration aids

---

# Annotations
# `@Experimental`

^ All of these are annotated with experimental

^ Sometimes causing an error, and sometimes a warning

^ Can be extended with your own annotations 

---

# üí™ Coroutines üí™

^ What makes everybody want to jump on the Coroutine bandwagon?

^ Two left arms because RTL emojis aren't a thing yet

---

# ü•á Native first-party library

^ First class support and documentation from JetBrains

^ Continued evolution and development of performance and features

^ Not relying on a third party implementation

^ Everything already awesome about Kotlin

---

# üòä Easy-to-use

^ Learning curve for getting started is really simple

---

# üëå `suspend fun`

^ Create suspended methods with the suspend operations

^ Methods need not care about scheduling

---

# `Dispatchers`

- Default
- IO
- Main
 - Android (Main Thread Dispatcher)
 - JavaFx (Application Thread Dispatcher)
 - Swing (Event Dispatcher Thread)
- Unconfined

^ - Default: Default for builders like launch, async, etc if neither a dispatcher or interceptor is specified

^ - IO: Designed for offloading blocking IO tasks to a shared pool of threads.

^ - Main: Confined to the Main thread operating with UI objects. Usually single-threaded.

^ - Unconfined: A coroutine dispatcher that is not confined to any specific thread

---

# üï∞Ô∏è History of Android

^ Handling asynchronous operations on Android has been really hard

^ Java 6 and lack of lambda support made code quite ugly

---

# Background Processes

^ Too many options for background tasks make it hard for beginners

---

## Background Processes

# üèõÔ∏èÔ∏è `Runnable` / `Handler`

^ The de facto standard for Android and Java background tasks

---

## Background Processes

# ü§¢ `AsyncTask`

^ Beloved AsyncTask risks memory leaks and confuses UI/background logic

---

## Background Processes

# üòï `IntentService`

^ Intent service "work queue processor" pattern to offload tasks

---

## Background Processes

# üçØ `Loader<T>`

^ Lifecycle aware loaders introduced in Honeycomb and compatibility library

---

## Background Processes

# ![](jetpack-icon.png) `WorkManager`

^ WorkManager released with JetPack, defers to JobScheduler, JobDispatcher or AlarmManager

^ Not even all of them, another ten in standard Android SDK

---

# üò©

^ Not even a comprehensive list, another ten native Android options

^ Decision paralysis, which is best for my project

^ AlarmManager, CountDownTimer, FutureTask, GcmNetworkManager, HandlerThread, JobDispatcher, JobScheduler, ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, Timer, Task<T>

---

^ No single option seems to match most requirements

^ Leading to new standards for individual use cases

---

# RxJava to the rescue

![right](rabbid-superhero.gif)

---

# ‚õìÔ∏è Chained operations

^ Allows us to compose chained operator sequences

---

# ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è Abstract threading

^ Abstract away threading, synchronisation, concerns

---

![right](over-the-top.gif)

# üòÆ Reactive

^ Introduced the concept of reactive programming

^ This was a major turning point for architecture

^ We lost our shit, and it quickly got out of hand

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

![65%](rx-libraries-one.jpg)

^ Started seeing libraries wrapping native API's

---

[.background-color: #ffffff]

[.background-color: #ffffff]

![65%](rx-libraries-four.jpg)

^ and more

---

![inline 100%](build-passing.png)

^ We learned that developers like readme badges

---

# üëç Asynchronous APIs

# Synchronous APIs üëé

^ Many of these libraries do a good job of providing asynchronous API's

^ When everything uses the same framework it's easy to fit together

^ But it doesn't make sense to use a reactive framework for synchronous API's

---

[.background-color: #222222]
[.footer-style: #ffffff]

![inline](rx-java-mapping.png)

^ RxJava2 introduced four new types with no common ancestor

^ Conversion functions often hard to remember, lead to complex code

---

# ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

```java
Observable
  .fromIterable(resourceDraft.getResources())
  .flatMap(resourceServiceApiClient::createUploadContainer)
  .zipWith(Observable.fromIterable(resourceDraft.getResources()), Pair::create)
  .flatMap(uploadResources())
  .toList()
  .toObservable()
  .flatMapMaybe(resourceCache.getResourceCachedItem())
  .defaultIfEmpty(Resource.getDefaultItem())
  .flatMap(postResource(resourceId, resourceDraft.getText(), currentUser, resourceDraft.getIntent()))
  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .subscribe(
      resource -> repository.setResource(resourceId, resource, provisionalResourceId),
      resourceUploadError(resourceId, resourceDraft, provisionalResourceId)
  );
```

^ Actual code sample from unnamed code base, from unnamed developer absolutely not in this room

^ How many of these operations seem unnecessary?

---

[.footer: Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (DreamWorks Pictures)]
[.footer-style: #ffffff]

![](escalated-quickly.jpg)

^ Well that escalated quickly...

^ Whilst chains and operators can be useful

^ They can quickly become unmanageable

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Hidden complexity

^ Business behaviour can often be hidden behind difficult to understand operators

^ Go back to previous slide, many statements feel unnecessary

---

# üò≠ Hidden gotchas

^ Behaviour often unpredictable when converting from Rx2 types

^ `Maybe` can be turned to `Completable` without completing

^ Combining operators behave differently if not all complete

^ Position of `observeOn` crucial to expected behaviour

---

# üíæ Memory footprint

^ RxJava objects take a lot of memory

^ Each operation large object allocation

---

# ‚§¥Ô∏è Steep learning curve

^ Steep learning curve for learning operator functions

^ Even after years of use still miss some behaviours

^ Have to be an implementation expert to fully understand

---

[.footer-style: #ffffff]

![](table-flip.gif)

^ Not the hero we wanted, or needed, or deserved.

^ Enough is enough

---

# #RxMustDie
## pca.st/7IJG

![right](rx-must-die.jpg)

^ Discussion panel on RxJava at Droidcon Berlin

^ Started from a Twitter discussion on RxJava API

^ API obstructive, difficult, obtuse, and unnecessary

^ Podcast available via Pocket Casts

---

> "If all you have is a hammer,<br /> everything looks like a nail"
-- Abraham Maslow, The Psychology of Science, 1966

^ Previous iterations of Android limited developers

^ RxJava was the only feasible tool of choice

^ No longer the case, many tools at our disposal

---

# Coroutine Use Cases

^ Simple use cases can be achieved in Coroutines without the overhead of reactive frameworks

---

# Network Call Handling

```kotlin
// RxJava2: Single<T>
fun getUser(): Single<User> = Single.fromCallable { /* ... */ }

// Coroutines: T
suspend fun getUser(): User = /* ... */
```

^ Ignoring presence of Retrofit we return result of network request

^ Assume network retrieval with client inside comment block

^ Simply suspend network call in coroutine function

---

# Cache Retrieval

```kotlin
// RxJava2: Maybe<T>
fun getUser(): Maybe<User> = Maybe.fromCallable { /* ... */ }

// Coroutines: T?
suspend fun getUser(): User? = /* ... */
```

^ Nullable value can be returned to represent empty

---

# Background Task Handling

```kotlin
// RxJava2: Completable
fun storeUser(user: User): Completable.fromCallable { /* ... */ }

// Coroutines: Unit
suspend fun storeUser(user: User) { /* ... */ }
```

---

# Thread Handling

```kotlin
// RxJava2
getUser()
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
  .subscribe { /* Do something */ }

// Coroutines
launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
  withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    val user = getUser()
    /* Do something */  
  }
}
```

^ Key difference is sequential operation of values

^ Imperative code much more readable

^ Value accessible instead of callback

---

# üí™ ~~FlatMap~~

```kotlin
// RxJava2
getUser()
  .flatMap { doSomethingWithUser(it) }
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
  .subscribe { /* Do something else */ }

// Coroutines
launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
  val user = getUser()
  val smth = doSomethingWithUser(user)
  
  /* Do something else */
}
```

^ Since value already accessible in scope flatMap no longer necessary

---

# Callback Consumption

```kotlin
// RxJava2
fun getSingle(): Single = Single.create<T> { emitter -> 
  doSomethingAsync(object: Callback<T> {
    override fun onComplete(result: T) = emitter.onSuccess(result)
    override fun onException(exception: Exception) = emitter.onError(exception)
  })
}

// Coroutines
suspend fun getCoroutine() : T = suspendCoroutine { continuation ->
  doSomethingAsync(object : Callback<T> {
    override fun onComplete(result: T) = continuation.resume(result)
    override fun onException(exception: Exception) = continuation.resumeWithException(exception)
  })
}
```

^ Things get a little more complicated consuming traditional interfaces

^ RxJava gives us `fromCallable` and `create` with an emitter to use callbacks

^ Coroutines has an almost identical approach using continuation instead of emitter

---

# Task Cancellation

```kotlin, [.highlight: 5, 10]
// RxJava2
val disposable: Disposable = Single
    .create { /* Do something */ }
    .subscribe { /* Do something else */ }
disposable.dispose()

// Coroutine
val parent: Job = Job()
launch(Dispatchers.Main + parent) { /* Do something */ }
parent.cancelChildren()
```

^ Many times you may need to cancel a request in flight, eg. orientation change, change of input etc

^ Handled almost identically with Job, addition operator applies values right to left

^ Cancelling a job will cancel all other jobs, use cancel children or `SupervisorJob`

^ Coroutines also offers job hierarchy, jobs nested and structured, useful, but different from RxJava

---

# üí™ Backpressure

^ RxJava Observables not originally backpressure aware

^ RxJava introduced `Flowable` for native support

---

# üí™ Backpressure

```kotlin
launch { 
  channel.send("Hello")
}
```

^ Channels only accept from coroutine context

^ end will wait until value popped (like queue)

---

# [fit] `ViewModel.viewModelScope`

## `androidx.lifecycle:2.1.0`

^ Coroutine scope hierarchy allows view model scope with androidx lifecycle

^ Jobs executed will be cancelled automatically on view model clear

---

# Channels üöá

^ Still marked as Obsolete, promoted to Experimental, use with care

^ Channel operations push/pull are bad for transformations

^ Not suitable as a drop in for Observables, but can be converted

---

[.footer: medium.com/@elizarov/cold-flows-hot-channels-d74769805f9]

![right](subset-over-drift-ice.jpg)

## Roman Elizarov
# Cold flows, hot channels

```kotlin
Flow.collect { 
  it.emit("Hello World!")
}
```

^ But there is hope, flow allows cold streams, some channel behaviours promoted

---

# Testing

```kotlin
@Test
fun testFoo() = runBlockingTest {
  val actual = foo() 
  // ...
}

suspend fun foo() {
  delay(1_000)
  // ...
}
```

^ Simply use the Coroutine builder `runBlockingTest` to build a testable context

^ Suspended operations in `runBlockingTest` will be auto-advanced virtual time

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è RxJava: Complex Business Logic

^ Debouncing, distinct filtering, side-effects

^ Operators from RxJava intentionally not created

^ Complex business logic, merging streams, etc

^ Possible to achieve in Coroutines but arduous

^ Not going to show how to do it

---

[.footer: medium.com/capital-one-tech/coroutines-and-rxjava-an-asynchronicity-comparison-part-1-asynchronous-programming-e726a925342a]

# [fit] Asynchronicity Comparison

## Manuel Vivo (@manuelvicnt)

^ Would like to go into more detail on these comparisons

^ Focus more on feasibility, practicality, and justification

^ Multi-part blog article, great comparison of the two frameworks
 
---

# [fit] Is Coroutines a replacement for RxJava?

^ Golden question

---

## Maybe...

^ The answer isn't so clear... maybe, but not really

^ Some behaviour can be replaced, perform different functions

^ Different levels of abstraction, can complement each other

^ Even possible for RxJava to be built with Coroutines

---

# [fit] Should I migrate to Coroutines?

---

## Probably not...

^ If something is already working, it does not need to be migrated

---

> "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
-- Bert Lance, Nation's Business, 1977

^ RxJava already provides a lot of worth for existing code

^ Coroutines perfect for new code or fresh projects

# [fit] Did *"you"* migrate to Coroutines?

^ If you asked me if I migrated?

---

![](hells-yeah.gif)

^ Kotlin and Coroutines are fun and a joy to use

^ Better understanding of code behaviour

^ Code often becomes much clearer

---

# [fit] How *could* I migrate to Coroutines?

---

# ü§ù Migration Policy

^ Agree upon a migration policy with your team

^ Start with low-level implementations

---

# Retrofit Services

---

[.footer: github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-260-2019-06-05]

# Retrofit 2.6.0
## Built-in suspend support

^ Retrofit Coroutine adapter library from Jake Wharton

---

```kotlin
interface UserService {

  @GET("/user")
  suspend fun getUser(): User
}

GlobalScope.launch {
    val user = retrofit
        .create<UserService>() // >= 2.5.0
        .getUser()
}
```

^ Reified type create call available from 2.5.0

^ Service defined as suspended

^ Can also wrap Response or Result as normal

---

# Coroutines RxJava2

## [fit] `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-rx2:+`

^ Convert suspended functions seamlessly

^ RxJava builders provide scope to consume suspend functions

^ Allows awaiting observable streams as channels (obsolete)

---

| **Name**        | **Scope**        | **Description**
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------
| `rxCompletable` | `CoroutineScope` | Cold completable that starts coroutine on subscribe
| `rxMaybe`       | `CoroutineScope` | Cold maybe that starts coroutine on subscribe
| `rxSingle`      | `CoroutineScope` | Cold single that starts coroutine on subscribe
| `rxObservable`  | `ProducerScope`  | Cold observable that starts coroutine on subscribe
| `rxFlowable`    | `ProducerScope`  | Cold observable that starts coroutine on subscribe with **backpressure** support 

^ Currently the only way to produce a cold stream with Coroutines

---

```kotlin, [.highlight: 3-4]
val service: UserService = retrofit.create()  // >= 2.5.0

GlobalScope
    .rxSingle { service.getUser() }
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .subscribe(
        { /* Do something with user */ },
        { /* Handle error ... probably */ }
    )
```

^ Take our user service from earlier, handle threading with RxJava

^ Context is an EmptyCoroutineContext, default values, inherits from scope

---

# Completable.await()

```kotlin, [.highlight: 4]
GlobalScope.launch {
  Completable
    .complete()
    .await()
}
```

^ Inversely you can convert Reactive types to simple variables with the same libary

^ Completable returns only unit, but awaiting will result in execution

---

# Maybe.await()

```kotlin, [.highlight: 4]
GlobalScope.launch {
  val result: String? = Maybe
    .fromCallable { null as String? }
    .await()

  // result == null
}
```

^ Maybe will return a nullable value with await

---

[.footer: kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-rx2/kotlinx.coroutines.rx2/io.reactivex.-observable-source/index.html]

# Observable.await...

```kotlin
val observable = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4)

// Await first item
val item = observable.awaitFirst()

// Print each item
observable.consumeEach(::println)

// Consume all items
observable
  .openSubscription()
  .consume {
    println(it.size)
  }
```

^ Conversely you can consume items from an observable within a Coroutine Scope

---

# Exceptions

---

# üòÖ Conclusion

^ Good idea of when its appropriate to use RxJava or Coroutines

^ Most of the time fine to use both, frameworks are complementary

^ Many other times you don't need complicated architecture

^ Now you have more than a hammer you can pick the right tool for the job
