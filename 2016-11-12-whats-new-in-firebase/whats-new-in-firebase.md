## What's Firebase?

^
- What is Firebase?
- This is how Google describes Firebase

---

![fit](firebase-developing-hard.png)

## Developing is Hard

^
- Developing modern apps is difficult

---

![fit](firebase-backend-scale.png)

^
- Need infrastructure that can scale
- Users expect high level compliancy

---

![fit](firebase-cross-platform.png)

^
- Cross platform collaboration
- Web, iOS, Android form factors
- Increasing number of platforms

---

![fit](firebase-auth.png)

^
- Social media integration
- Just to be considered

---

![inline](firebase.png)

^
- Firebase allows you to move quickly
- Without the worry of building infrastructure
- Series of tools to develop your apps
- Bring users to your app
- Grow your user base
- Earn money

---

![fit](firebase-all-tools.png)

^
- Set of 15 features
- Built around analytics
- Seamlessly communicate

---

![fit](firebase-auth.png)
## [fit] Authentication
- Authentication & account management
- Email & password authentication
- Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub
- Custom OAuth2 redirect domains

^
- Allows login with third party accounts
- Now runs with Google own authentication servers
- Firebase UI provides prepared environment set up

---

![fit](firebase-backend-scale.png)
## [fit]Â Realtime
## [fit] Database

^
- Firebase started as real time database
- Now a suite of development services
- Power still in Firebase Realtime Database

---

![fit](firebase-backend-scale.png)
## [fit] Data Synchronisation
- Graceful Connectivity Loss

^
- Would normally need lots of logic
- Handles poor connectivity gracefully

---

![fit](firebase-backend-scale.png)
## [fit] Data Synchronisation
- Graceful Connectivity Loss
- Application Data Cache

^
- Application data cached automatically
- Forget about connectivity issues
- Firebase will remain responsive
- Will synchronise when connectivity returns
- User auth tokens persisted
- Data writes resumed after token re-authentication

---

![fit](firebase-backend-scale.png)
## [fit] Data Synchronisation
- Graceful Connectivity Loss
- Application Data Cache
- Client Synchronisation

^
- Data is synchronised across all connected clients across platforms
- All clients share same realtime database with newest data
- Data freshness synchronised in real time

---

![fit](firebase-backend-scale.png)
## [fit] Data Synchronisation
- Graceful Connectivity Loss
- Application Data Cache
- Client Synchronisation
- Conflict Resolution

^
- Whilst Firebase doesn't yet support the ability to resolve complex conflicts
- Most conflicts will be automatically merged without any intervention required

---

## 10MB Cache

^
- Firebase will reserve up to 10MB by default to cache query results
- Will purge this data once it reaches the configured size.
- Data that is kept in sync however will not be cached.

---

## Can I still change the configured cache size?

---

## [fit] No!

^
- Legacy version used `setPersistenceCacheSizeBytes()`
- Too much memory usage causes out of memory errors

---

## [fit] Cloud Hosted
## [fit] NoSql Database

^
- Your data is stored in a cloud hosted NoSql database powered by Google
- NoSql data structures can provide huge increases to speed and performance
- Require a different way of thinking when it comes to relational data structures

---

```json
{
  "users": {
    "alovelace": {
      "name": "Ada Lovelace",
      "contacts": {
        "ghopper": true
      },
    },
    "ghopper": { ... },
    "eclarke": { ... }
  }
}
```

^
- Data is structured as a Json tree of key, value parameters
- Data must be de-normalized and some data might need to be repeated
- Structures do not really support relational data
- UUID keys easier to index when calling setValue

---

## What's New?

^
- Major changes to how Firebase is included in your project
- It is now fully integrated into Google Services
- Effortlessly interleave with the other aspects of your set up

---

## Set Up

```java
// Legacy SDK
compile "com.firebase:firebase-client-android:2.5.2"

// Distributed SDK
compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-core:9.8.0"
compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:9.8.0"
compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-database:9.8.0"
compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-crash:9.8.0"
compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-config:9.8.0"
```

^
- The original Firebase SDK only provides auth and database
- Broken these down into individual modular components
- Choose which you want to include in your project
- Analytics not included separately but in core (2k)

---

![](firebase-google-play-services.png)

^
- Google Play Services file in the Firebase console

---

```groovy
dependencies {
  // ...
}

apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

^
- Google play services after dependencies
- Will result in conflicts otherwise

---

## The Tasks API[^1]

```java
Task<AuthResult> task = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().signInAnonymously();

task.addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<AuthResult>() {
  @Override public void onSuccess(AuthResult result) {
    /* ... */
  }
});

task.addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() {
  @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception exception) {
    /* ... */
  }
});
```

[^1]: https://developers.google.com/android/guides/tasks

^
- Since Firebase is now tied in with Google Play Services, many of its API operations use the Tasks API
- The Tasks API provides a meaningful semantic interface for asynchronous operations
- Which by themselves are more than enough to allow your application to follow a logical data flow
