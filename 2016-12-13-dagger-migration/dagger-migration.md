## [fit] AN-1220 Create scoped graphs for required activities
## [fit] AN-1226 Persist injector though configuration change

**Problem**
- Retention of custom non configuration instance not used consistently

## [fit] AN-1220 Create scoped graphs for required activities
## [fit] AN-1226 Persist injector though configuration change

**Problem**
- Retention of custom non configuration instance not used consistently

**Solution**
- Creating scoped graphs for remaining activities
- Implement mandatory scoped graph persistence

## [fit] AN-1300 Repurpose Injector as Component wrapper
## [fit] AN-1221 Wrap graph with custom Component class
## [fit] AN-1224 Create components for each scoped graph

**Problem**
- Components should have injection responsibility

## [fit] AN-1221 Wrap graph with custom Component class
## [fit] AN-1224 Create components for each scoped graph

**Problem**
- Components should have injection responsibility

**Solution**
- Wrap existing application graph
- Create components for each graph

## [fit] AN-1238 Reduce usage of Component casting

**Problem**
- Fragments cast activity context to injector
- Components will be many, not just a single interface
- Activity not guaranteed to have expected component

**Problem**
- Fragments cast activity context to injector
- Components will be many, not just a single interface
- Activity not guaranteed to have expected component

**Solution**
- Retrieve component from application context

## [fit] AN-1358 Remove Injection for parameterized types

**Problem**
- Dagger 2 can only inject explicit parameterized types

---

## [fit] AN-1358 Remove Injection for parameterized types

**Problem**
- Dagger 2 can only inject explicit parameterized types

**Solution**
- Provide injection targets as inner "helper" classes

---

## [fit] AN-1223 Prepare activity injection interface
## [fit] AN-1239 Provide alternative module override
## [fit] AN-1344 DaggerActivity to ComponentActivity

**Problem**
- Injection targets must be explicitly defined
- Injection targets must define their component

---

## [fit] AN-1239 Provide alternative module override
## [fit] AN-1344 DaggerActivity to ComponentActivity

**Problem**
- Injection targets must be explicitly defined
